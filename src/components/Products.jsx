          <p>
            Far too often, organizations know the threats they face, but fail to recognize the face of threats.
             It doesn‚Äôt have to be that way. Security teams can spend up to 80% of their time searching for known 
             perpetrators or individuals flagged as threats. Yet, 60% of these same security professionals say they 
             struggle to monitor and identify known persons of interest in real-time.
          </p>

          <p>
            OnWatch reliably helps you find that proverbial needle in the haystack - in real-time, real-world conditions,
             so that your security team can focus on doing what it does best.
